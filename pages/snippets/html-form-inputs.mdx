Writing semantic HTML is arguably the most important thing a developer can do to improve the accessibility of a website. User-friendly forms can often be tricky to design, especially if asking for a lot of information, so we need to make sure that the implementation is not creating more friction for our users.

## The basics

First, we need to pair our input with a label. We can either wrap the label around the input, or use the `for` and `id` attributes.

**Option 1 (label wrapped around input):**

```html
<label>
  First name
  <input type="text" />
</label>
```

**Option 2 (the `for` attribute of the label matches the `id` of the form control):**

<CodeTabs label="Pairing an input with a label" tabs={["HTML","React"]}>

<CodeTab label="HTML">

```html
<label for="firstname">First name</label>
<input type="text" id="firstname" />
```

</CodeTab>

<CodeTab label="React">

```html
<label htmlFor="firstname">First name</label>
<input type="text" id="firstname" />
```

</CodeTab>

</CodeTabs>

Associating inputs with labels is important for screen reader users (so they know what information to enter), but also for sighted users; remember that labels should always be visible, even if the input has a value. So don’t use placeholders as labels!

## The type attribute

In the example above, the input is for the user’s first name, so we set the `type` as `text`. The `type` attribute lets the browser know what input to render and how the user can interact with it. Just because the value of an input is a string, it doesn’t necessarily mean that the `type` should be `text`: it could also be `email`, `password`, `url`, or even `color`. The same thing applies to numbers: if we needed users to enter a phone number, we’d use `tel` instead of `number`. You can read more about input types in the [MDN docs](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/input#input_types).

<CodeTabs label="Input types examples" tabs={["email","number", "password", "url", "tel"]}>

<CodeTab label="email">

```html
<label>
  Email address
  <input type="email" />
</label>
```

</CodeTab>

<CodeTab label="number">

```html
<label>
  Quantity
  <input type="number" />
</label>
```

</CodeTab>

<CodeTab label="password">

```html
<label>
  Password
  <input type="password" />
</label>
```

</CodeTab>

<CodeTab label="url">

```html
<label>
  Website URL
  <input type="url" />
</label>
```

</CodeTab>

<CodeTab label="tel">

```html
<label>
  Phone number
  <input type="tel" />
</label>
```

</CodeTab>

</CodeTabs>

<Callout>The default `type` of an HTML input is `text`.</Callout>

## The required attribute

The `required` attribute marks the input as invalid when empty and prevents it from being submitted to the server.

```html
<label>
  Phone number (required)
  <input type="tel" required />
</label>
```

Note that even if you are handling your form validation with JavaScript, you should still use the `required` attribute where relevant, as it will allow screen readers to announce the input as required. You can then style your inputs using the `:valid` and `:invalid` CSS pseudo-classes.

Your form validation logic should also add the `aria-invalid` attribute to invalid inputs so they can be properly flagged by screen readers and other user agents.

## The inputmode attribute

If we set the `type` of an input, user agents might adapt the keyboard to the expected format; for example, the iOS keyboard for `email` inputs will typically include the `@` character. But that’s not true for all input types; iOS just renders a regular keyboard for `number` inputs. In this case, we can use the `inputmode` attribute. We can set it to `numeric` to show the numeric keyboard with the digits 0-9, or we can set it to `decimal` to allow fractional numbers.
[Here’s a good resource with screenshots of the different keyboards](https://css-tricks.com/everything-you-ever-wanted-to-know-about-inputmode/)

```html
<label>
  Phone number
  <input type="tel" inputmode="tel" />
</label>
```

Note that unlike `type`, `inputmode` won’t affect validation.

You can read more about the `inputmode` attribute in the [MDN docs](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Global_attributes/inputmode).

## The autocomplete attribute

The last thing we can do to help our users fill our forms more quickly is adding autocomplete support. The `autocomplete` attribute allows user agents to identify the format of the expected value for an input, and pre-fill the values accordingly. This makes forms more efficient for all users, especially users that are attention deficit, have cognitive impairments, reduced mobility, low vision, or blind users.

`autocomplete` allows us to get a lot more specific than by just using `type`: a name field might have an autocomplete value of `name`, `given-name`, `additional-name`, `family-name`, or even `nickname`. But all of these would use a regular `text` input type.

A `password` field can also have multiple `autocomplete` values: `new-password` will let user agents and password managers know to generate a new password for your website, while `current-password` will fill the field with an existing password.

Ever wondered how your phone can pre-fill a one-time-code that was texted to you? This requires just one line of HTML: `autocomplete="one-time-code"`!

<CodeTabs label="Autocomplete values examples" tabs={["new-password","one-time-code"]}>

<CodeTab label="new-password">

```html
<label>
  Password
  <input type="password" autocomplete="new-password" />
</label>
```

</CodeTab>

<CodeTab label="one-time-code">

```html
<label>
  Authentication token
  <input type="number" inputmode="numeric" autocomplete="one-time-code" />
</label>
```

</CodeTab>

</CodeTabs>

The `autocomplete` attribute doesn’t affect validation. You can read more about `autocomplete` in the [MDN docs](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Attributes/autocomplete).

<Callout title="A quick note about internationalisation">
  The concept of "first name" and "last name" is not international. So if you
  can, avoid breaking the name down into components, and just use `name` (or
  `username`).
</Callout>

## Additional attributes

Depending on the `type` of an input, there might be some additional attributes that we need to set. For example:

- `file` inputs have an `accept` attribute that lets us set the formats the input should accept (.png, .jpeg, .doc, .pdf, etc)
- `number` inputs can have a `min` and a `max` value
- `tel` inputs can have a `minlength` and a `maxlength`

<CodeTabs label="Additional attributes examples" tabs={["image","number", "tel"]}>

<CodeTab label="image">

```html
<label>
  Profile picture
  <input type="file" accept="image/png, image/jpeg" />
</label>
```

</CodeTab>

<CodeTab label="number">

```html
<label>
  Quantity
  <input type="number" inputmode="numeric" min="1" max="10" />
</label>
```

</CodeTab>

<CodeTab label="tel">

```html
<label>
  Phone number
  <input type="tel" inputmode="tel" minlength="8" maxlength="10" />
</label>
```

</CodeTab>

</CodeTabs>

Some inputs will also accept the `pattern` attribute, which allows us to further restrict entered values so they also have to conform to a specific pattern, using a regular expression (RegEx).

```html
<label>
  Phone number (in the form XXX-XXX-XXXX):
  <input type="tel" inputmode="tel" pattern="[0-9]{3}-[0-9]{3}-[0-9]{4}" />
</label>
```

<Callout>
  Regardless of how you choose to handle form validation on the client-side,
  remember that is is still easy to bypass, so your apps should always perform
  security checks on any submitted data on the server-side as well.
